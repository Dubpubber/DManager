# Project Purpose
The purpose of DManager is to provide a proper tool for managing any "Dungeons and Dragons" campaign from a Dungeon Master's perspective. This type of tool is needed to avoid wasting time looking up a spells, items, monsters, etc. thus, prolonging game-play. Instead of manually relying on the Dungeon Master's handbook and notes, this tool can be utilized to better manage the campaign.
